This directory focuses on using xrandr to set up monitor configs.

Here is a description of each script:
 - mirror-monitor: mirrors the screen to monitor
 - background-check-disconnection: checks if HDMI is connected. If not, resets to normal

TO-DO:
 - Create a script that is a TUI to select options for config
